## What is Separate Legal Personality?

Separate legal personality is a concept in the world of business and law that allows a company to be treated as a separate entity from its owners (shareholders). This means that a company can enter into contracts, own property, and sue or be sued, just like a person can.

In other words, a company is seen as its own person in the eyes of the law, separate from the shareholders or directors. This has a number of important implications. For example, if a company gets into financial trouble, its shareholders are not personally liable for its debts or other obligations.

To take a step back for a moment, any company has two things: (1) shareholders and (2) directors. The shareholders are the owners of the company because they own the shares in the company. That makes them owners. If a company has 100 shares and person 1 has 50 shares and person 2 has 50 shares, they are both shareholders owning 50% of the company each. 

Directors on the other hand can be shareholders too, but might not be. It is likely that you will be both the only shareholder and the only director of your company. While the shareholder's only job is to own the shares, the director's job is to run the company and be responsible for the obligations of the company. 


## Keeping your personal assets safe

The idea of separate legal personality is an important one because it allows businesses to operate with a certain degree of autonomy and independence. It also allows investors and shareholders to take part in the success of a company without being held responsible for any losses.

However, it is important to note that separate legal personality does not mean that companies can act with complete impunity. They are still subject to the laws and regulations that govern their activities, and can be held accountable for any illegal or unethical behavior.

## An example

Let's say that you started a business with a few friends, and you all put in some money to get it up and running. Unfortunately, the business didn't take off as you had hoped, and you ended up with a lot of debts that you couldn't pay.

If your business had a separate legal personality, then you and your friends would not be personally liable for the debts of the company. Instead, the creditors would have to go after the assets of the company itself to recover what they are owed. This means that your personal assets, such as your car or your house, would be safe from any claims made by the creditors.

Without the concept of separate legal personality, the creditors could potentially go after the personal assets of the business owners to recover their debts, which could be devastating for you and your friends. By having a separate legal personality, the business can be treated as its own entity, protecting the personal assets of the owners in the event that the business venture turns bad.
